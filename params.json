{"name":"q","tagline":"q - Text as Data","body":"# q - Treating Text as a Database \r\n\r\n## Implementation \r\n\r\nThe current implementation is written in Python using an in-memory database, in order to prevent the need for external dependencies. The implementation itself supports SELECT statements, including JOINs (Subqueries are supported only in the WHERE clause for now).\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is currently no checks and bounds on data size - It's up to the user to make sure things don't get too big.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read the limitations section as well.\r\n\r\nCode wise, I'm planning for a big refactoring, and I have added full test suite in the latest version, so it'll be easier to do properly.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThe code includes a test suite runnable through `test/test-all`. If you're planning on sending a pull request, I'd appreciate if you could make sure that it doesn't fail. Additional ideas related to testing are most welcome.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nAny feedback/suggestions/complaints regarding this tool would be much appreciated. Contributions are most welcome as well, of course.\r\n\r\nHarel Ben-Attia, harelba@gmail.com, [@harelba](https://twitter.com/harelba) on Twitter\r\n","google":"UA-48316355-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
