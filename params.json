Python 3.x is not supported yet.\r\n\r\n### Mac Users\r\nMake sure you run `brew update` first and then just run `brew install q`. \r\n\r\nThanks [@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie) for the initial homebrew formula\r\n\r\n### Manual installation (very simple, since there are no dependencies)\r\n\r\n1. Download the main q executable from **[here](https://raw.github.com/harelba/q/1.4.0/bin/q)** into a folder in the PATH.\r\n2. Make the file executable.\r\n\r\nFor `Windows` machines, also download q.bat **[here](https://raw.github.com/harelba/q/1.4.0/bin/q.bat)** into the same folder and use it to run q.\r\n\r\n### RPM-Base Linux distributions\r\nDownload the version `1.4.0` RPM here **[here](https://github.com/harelba/packages-for-q/raw/master/rpms/q-text-as-data-1.4.0-1.noarch.rpm)**. \r\n\r\nInstall using `rpm -ivh <rpm-name>`.\r\n\r\nRPM Releases also contain a man page. Just enter `man q`.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** In Version `1.4.0`, the RPM package name has been changed. If you already have the old version, just remove it with `rpm -e q` before installing.\r\n\r\n### Debian-based Linux distributions\r\nDebian packaing is in progress. In the mean time install manually. See the section above.\r\n\r\n### Arch Linux\r\n\r\nA `PKGBUILD` is [available](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/q/) in AUR for Arch Linux users. See [installing packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages) in the wiki or use your favorite [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Aur_helpers).\r\n\r\nThe man page is also provided (extracted _as is_ from the RPM): `man q`\r\n\r\n## Default settings file\r\nq supports an option file in ~/.qrc or in the working directory (with the name .qrc) which provides defaults for some or all of the command line options. A sample .qrc file with commented-out options is included. Just put it in your home folder and modify it according to your needs.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nAny feedback/suggestions/complaints regarding this tool would be much appreciated. Contributions are most welcome as well, of course.\r\n\r\nHarel Ben-Attia, harelba@gmail.com, [@harelba](https://twitter.com/harelba) on Twitter\r\n","google":"UA-48316355-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
